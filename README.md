## ⚡ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (responsive, dark mode, custom UI)
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **FontAwesome** (icons)
- **LocalStorage** (save favorites, playlists, theme)

## 🎨 Customization

- Change theme colors in `styles.css` via `:root` variables
- Add more music formats by updating supported file types in `script.js`

## 📝 Notes

- **No music leaves your browser:** Everything stays local—a privacy-first design.
- Album art is only supported if music files have embedded cover images.
- Some features (like persistent albums on refresh) depend on browser session—which means actual audio files aren't stored, only metadata.
